Testing the efficiency of the DClusTree based stream clustering algorithm

An attempt to parallelize the Stream Clustering Algorithm proposed by Seidl, T.;Kranen, P. ;Assent, I.; Baldauf, C. in their paper Self-Adaptive Anytime Stream Clustering (ICDM '09), by modifying the ClusTree to a DClusTree (Distributed-ClusTree).
